# Tetagrammaton Explained In Terms of Simple Learning

#iching #magick #understanding #occult #truth #processes

Life on Earth as we know it consists of countless patterns, emerging and ordering in a particular (self-similar) way, while consciousness is the reading/experience apparatus that moves along these patterns.

Take for example the simple act of writing.

Writing as we know it, consists of putting ink on a piece of paper. If done on white paper, almost all the light falling on the paper reflects off the piece of paper, except in the locations where the ink was applied. In those locations, we don't see light (or see less of it) as it's not reflected. This difference in light intensity on a single surface is a phenomenon which causes a series of reflections to occur insight our eyes: the letters of a word, either read or written, reflect inside the mind's eye, more specifically on the back of the eye where the retina is located.

In the back of the eye we have a retina, and this retina translates spacial photon-patterns into a signal to the brain. Seemingly ancient boring self-obvious knowledge, but the depth of understanding which could come about from truly understanding and noticing this naturally occuring process, is of utmost importance to further deepen yourself in the understanding of the whole, in the small. And of understanding the small, in light of the whole.

Here's what actually happens.

The light falling on a sheet of paper with text, and reflecting into your eyes, is forming a chemical "excitation" on your retina screen. The retina is made out of cones, the "camera-sensors" in the eye. Certain cones in your eye are red, others are blue, yet others are green. Now the key here is to understand that white light is a combination of red, blue and green light, thus firing all those cones at the same time. Blue light will mostly only trigger the blue cones. So "black ink", black-on-white, which reflects nothing, will cause no-reflection, or  no-light, which  will trigger no or little cones on the retina in that particular region of your retina.

The retina containing all these light-selective cones, bundle these excited cone-signals into some type of USB-cable which then plugs into our brain, stimulating it in his already ongoing signal traffic of previous stimuli. A better description for this cable (optic nerve) would be UPB, a Universal Parallel Bus, as USB transfers its data through 2 cables in a series, while the eye tranfers light-pattern information through on average 1 million nerve endings [1]. This set of parallel cables plugs into our brain, and stimulates the already-ongoing signal-traffic.

Cool.

What's important to notice is that the shape and symbols used in a set of letters, called an alphabet, they're pouring "inside" into your brain. Black symbols, or lines, lacking reflection of light, form regions on a white screen where there's no light. This "image" goes through the eye/optic nerve/brain/body totality, into the planes of YOUR INNER EXISTENCE. Groups of symbols form words, and they together cause certain states-of-mind **SHIFTS** which make us recognize some real-world phenomenon.

In reverse, when we want to convey certain real-world experience to someone else, we start from pre-trained ordered storage, or memory bank (the BRAIN) and translate it into a whole series of letters, words and sentences.

The other person will, while READING your collection of symbols, reshuffle his current state of being into another one, bringing him to an understanding of what you want to say.

This same idea or principle applies to sound, speech, and languages. A body has sensitive vibration-sensors, called the ears, which oh so gently come in resonance with the produced vibrations by some other membrane (like someone ele's throat, a speaker, or natural phenomena). This is then translated into a series of stimili-over-time, which puts a brain (body!) in a different state than before.

For a practical example of the above description, imagine one being angry as fuck, but then the gracious voice of reason and love detangles the angry-brain state into a new state of "ho man... I feel understood. And I'm here with another person. Perhaps I was, or still am pissed, but life is too beautiful to be angry as fuck". Now these WORDS MAY NOT BE THOUGHT LETTER BY LETTER, but the underlying swaying and bubbling chemical cocktail which forms the unconscious mind, might aswell produce this articulation of the experience state of mind, albeit if the body faculties are _self-conscious_, _honest_, and _developed_ enough (and can play with a collection of meaning used as pointers, better known as the English language).

So recapping, both hearing/speaking, and writing/reading/seeing, are a series of activities, a series of infinitely repeated biological and physical patterns by human beings in an envrionment, which when given some context, cause a collection of impulses to be retriggered by incoming bundles of absorbed sound-patterns (listening), or light-patterns (reading).


# Learning, or how I like to call it "Inertialization of Action"

How does a child learn how to bundle (from his perspective) an external phenomenon called "mother", the person that plunged you into this physical existence, onto a 4-letter word "MAMA", or the sound of /MAMA/ (in phonetic script /ˈmæmə/)?

The answer consists in the understanding and internalization of a 4-step process:

1. **Have an initial set of possibilities**
2. **Impose a limitation onto those possiblities**, as to direct (limit) the all possible outcomes into something less, thus creating a probability (with a p(x) < 1)
3. **Condensation or "cool-down" of the imposed limitation (friction) "on it's own accord"**, meaning that the force which sustained those limitation are now gone, and the imprint of limitation now needs to glow on its own. This after-glow gently fades-over time, unless re-applied by another limitation, sustained period of time.
4. **The "inertialization" of the limitation**, meaning it's now limiting outcome and causing probabilities to occur on its own. The repeated battle and hence-and-forth between "LIMIT THE OUTCOME" (step 2) and "ENOUGH LIMITING" (step 3) leads to habit forming. See it as a finally established MANNER OF GUIDING THE SOUND-SIGNAL OR LIGHT-SIGNAL TO THE DESIRED OUTCOME.

I feel the heavens and earth rumbling with revolt and what-the-fuckness, so allow me to lay out the starting example of associating the "mother"-sound with the "mother" multi-layered-concept and real-world impressed phenomena of **his mother** in a child's mind.

1. **Initial set of possiblities**: A baby's brain, fresh and unravaged as it is, can learn anything. His brain can react to stimuli, and then react to some other stimuli. Then it may produce some other type of stimuli, etc ... But it's just one big all-goes electric super network. No walls, no filters, no pathways through which thoughts can go through. It just is and has all this possibility. Attached to the brains are eyes and ears. They can see and hear infinite types and/or combinations of sound and visual imagery. 
2. **Imposed Limitation**: The mother puts her face in front of her baby's eyes and says, repeatedly, "MAMA". Then again she repeat "MAMA". "MAAMAA". At this point 2 things are happening.
    1. The baby receives all kinds of visual impressions and pictures (light-patterns) of this "talking bundle of flesh, bones and skin".
    2. The baby receives a particular repeating sound pattern: "MAMA".

Let's dissect this for a little bit to understand what's up. The baby's brain receives impulses, both visual and auditory. Of all that could ever been seen or heard, the baby's perceptions are quite adruptedly being limited by her mom's wish to make her baby recognize her as mama. She comes close to the baby, covering the baby's whole visual field, and produces a periodic vocal sound.

The mom here, LIMITED THE FIELD OF POSSIBILITY both in the audible and visual spectrum. And she repeated it no-less, meaning that it's sustained. It's pushed, perhaps even ignited with passion, in a single direction.

Now comes the next part.

3. **Condensation (or come down) of imposed limitation**: mom shuts up, and leaves, say 10m away. The baby's previously limited field of hearing and seeing is now exposed to a lot more _other possiblities_, yet because of previous events, the lack of possibility-filtering (hearing "mama" and seeing "mama") is now on it's own in the baby's brain. The stimulation of seeing and hearing momma for a period is now gonne, but the impression lasts like an afterglow from looking (like an idiot) at the sun for too long.

So what's up here? After her throat got dry, the mom leaves the baby, and remains silent. The stimulation imposed by limiting the visual and auditory spectrum of the baby is now gone. The baby receives a view of the room, and hears the footsteps of mom going away, then hears the dog barking. The baby is plunged back into a wider sea of possibilities, but because of the previous persisting limitation imposed by her mom, the "after-glow" of **"Seeing Person That Says Mom"** and **"Hearing person that says MAMA"** is still in effect. Essentially... now that mom is gone, there's no more sound that produces "mama", and the sight of seeing momma is gone, yet the impressions in the brain will linger more for a while, and then fade more and more, till it's only a faint faint impression (or memory) of something ever happening.

4. **The "inertialization" of the limitation**: the baby's-brain chemical make up has been changed, ever so slightly, because it got stimulated, and it got a chance to cool off in the sea of other possililites (and or limitations imposed). It's not like the baby now automatically learned who mama is, how mama looks like, or how mama will behave, but the interaction (limitation of perceived possibility) has been made inert by the memory-bank, by the brain, by the short-term memory (don't want to get to deep in details here).

But then... Step 2 happens again! Mom comes back to her baby, now (say) looking at her baby from a 1m distance, and says "mama". "mama". The mom filters the perceptions of the baby, albeit in a slightly different way, yet it still stimulates and filters the perception _because she wants her baby to call her mama, including all that she was, is, and will be_.

Then Step 3 occurs again, mom leaves, and the stimulated brain has a chance to cool off. Not only that but the baby's brother comes along, the baby sees him, and he said "mama". But he doesn't receive the same visual-field limitation as when her mom spoke to him, so he's like "... WEIRD ...", and more cooling down happens of the previous "passionate, firy attempt of the baby's mom of filtering the baby's perception".

Here then again Step 4 occurs: the moving and electrical brain-stuff now has received more cooled-down imporessions into his memory bank, or "inertialization" of what and who mom is, what sound she is, and how she looks.

Given enough step 2 and step 3 repetitions, eventually the brain-wires of the baby will be thus 'inertialized' that whenever he only sees mom, the signals in his brain will be guided through vast inner paths "expecting" the sound "mama", or perhaps producing the sound itself, because it's so well baked-in.

Notes:

- In this example I'm omitting millions of other factors that contribute, as well as other input facilities like the smell, taste and touch of the baby, which also act as input information when mom engages in step 2.


# TEGRAGRAMMATON and the 4 steps

Step 1 to 4 seems to not only apply to learning, but also to any change aspect on physical Earth to anything that one wants in one's life*. Perhaps it even describes basic interactions, the creation of the universe, and the future of your life here on Earth. This hypothesis remains to be tested until exhaustion.

The step 1-4 formula is derived from the TETRAGRAMMATON, a 4-letter hebrew word YHVH, or in Hebrew יהוה.

The four lettter word describes a law by which things manifest in this universe. Right now it's only a hypothesis of course.

The four letter word is associated with the 4 elements:

- Y = Air  = Moveability = Possibility = Range of motion. In Hebrew it means "hand", pointing to everything a hand can do.
- H = Fire = Desire = Expansion = Filtering of possibility. It means something through which things are seen, or a "window" im Hebrew.
- V = Water = Cooling Off = Coming Down = Condensation = removal of the filter-of-possibility and being exposed to all other possilibities and/or results of previously inert-made filters-of-possibilities. It means "nail" in Hebrew, pointing at the fact how a nail pierces through many layers of material and somehow binds them together, in rest.
- H = Earth = Made inert = Matter = Repeatably "NOT ALL POSSIBILITY" = almost constantly, unmovable limited possibility = Ingrained Invisible Wall = Habit

The reason why Jews are often refered to as wrestlers with God

* never forget that we can't run when we still learning to walk, in the same way, one can't manifest ANYTHING from day 1, but given gradual build up and some time, everything is fantastically possible.

# In conclusion

Taking an example in the baby learning his mother by her vocal name, learning to write, or to read, undergoes the exact same meta-process, which is:

> To _somehow_ go (you as a body in a world, a world with your body) through a process of mental/bodily/environmental reconfigurations, which allow you to transfigure a set of possibilities to an earthly stored, experienced, habituated **inert pattern-producing matter**.

In case of the brain, the inert matter is trained brain circuits.

In case of terra forming, the inert matter is a channel which guides water effordlessly along its banks.

In case of programming, the inert matter is an electrical configuration guiding electron signals through a PROGRAMMED SET OF INSTRUCTIONS.

In case of culture, the inert matter is an deeply ingrained and agreed-upon set of behavioral conduct in different situations.

In case of business, the inert matter is a collection of software and rules guiding value for exchange for another type of value.

In case of engineering, the inert matter is a collection of components and element compounds, acting together in a predictable, accurate and precise way, as to always cause a certain result (a machine).

I'm putting a lot in here, which is nice.

And most happens through the medium of the eye, the evolutionary cup of light, wheras the light is the fire itself, spinning up from the heavily worked quantum field in/around/through the sun. Or a lamp (another inert piece of matter which guides electrons to cause predicably behavior to occur, aka shining light).
